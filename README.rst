PCBmodEZero
===========

Experimental Python frontend to PCBmodE.

Highlights:

- programtic configuration (e.g. reuse config generated from functions, use constants, )
- procedural generation of PCB's in Python, e.g. use loops and generatate paths
- consise 'dot' syntax for configuration
- copy, and slightly modifiy (e.g. location), existing components to new components
- defaulted configuration options (e.g. documentation font defaults)
- import SVG files as 'paths', rather than using embedded SVG path strings
- saving the config automatically triggers `pcbmode` command utility to generate files
